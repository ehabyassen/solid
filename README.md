#SOLID PRINCIPLES

This simple project is a trial to explain to myself how applying the SOLID principles helps in managing source code dependencies.
It is inspired by and applying some Ideas from:

[Breaking Dependencies: The SOLID Principles by Klaus Iglberger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT-npV1JRKE)

[The S.O.L.I.D Principles in Pictures](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/the-s-o-l-i-d-principles-in-pictures-b34ce2f1e898)

'Soft' in 'Software' means easy to change and extend.

According to Wikipedia, SOLID are 5 design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. They are:

- Single Responsibility Principle (srp)
- Open-Closed Principle (ocp)
- Liskuv Substitution Principle (lsp)
- Interface Segregation Principle (isp)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (dip)

Under each package, there is a packageInfo file explaining the relative principle, the example where the principle is applied before and after.
